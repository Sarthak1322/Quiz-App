Building a quiz app with Flutter that has both web and mobile views is a great idea! Here's a general outline of how you could approach it:

Design: Start by designing your app's user interface. You mentioned using Figma, which is great for designing UI mockups. Design separate layouts for mobile and web views, keeping in mind the differences in screen sizes and user interaction patterns.

Flutter Setup: Set up a new Flutter project and configure it to support both web and mobile platforms. You can use the Flutter SDK to create a new project or add web support to an existing one.

API Integration: You mentioned using POST and GET APIs. Determine what data your app will need from the server. This could include quiz questions, user scores, etc. Use Flutter's http package to make HTTP requests to your server and handle responses.

Authentication (if needed): If your app requires user authentication, implement it using tokens or sessions. You can use packages like flutter_secure_storage to securely store authentication tokens on the device.

Quiz Logic: Implement the logic for displaying quiz questions and handling user responses. This could involve fetching quiz questions from the server, displaying them to the user, and verifying their answers.

UI Implementation: Use Flutter widgets to implement the UI design created in Figma. Customize the layout and styling for both mobile and web views using responsive design techniques.

Testing: Test your app thoroughly on both mobile devices and web browsers to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios. Consider using device emulators/simulators for testing on different screen sizes.

Deployment: Once your app is ready, deploy it to the desired platforms. For web deployment, you can use hosting services like Firebase Hosting or GitHub Pages. For mobile deployment, publish your app to the Google Play Store and/or Apple App Store.

Iterate and Improve: Gather feedback from users and monitor app performance. Continuously iterate and improve your app based on user feedback and analytics data.

By following these steps, you should be able to build a quiz app with Flutter that works on both web and mobile platforms, integrates with APIs for data retrieval, and has a user-friendly interface designed in Figma.
